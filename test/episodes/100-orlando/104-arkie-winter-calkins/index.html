			<h2>True Love</h2>
			<h3>By Andrew Nater</h3>

			<p>I’m going to talk about love for a minute. Despite popular mechanics of communication telling us otherwise, love is rarely as rigid and clear as we’ve come to dream it. In fact, that is often for the better. It’s hard to truly capture love, it’s such a uniquely multifaceted emotion. But, what about true love? Soul mates! Companionship!</p>

			<p>That love, in particular, is likely the hardest to a) identify and b) effectively capture. This episode is entirely about love. 100%. If you don’t feel it, you can blame Hollywood — they’ve tricked us into believing romance is love. But you should feel it, it’s everywhere. Love for the environment. Love for Orlando. Love for the craft of art and music. Love for each other. </p>

			<p>You see, the love that Arkie and Winter share is so infectious in its positivity and inspiration that it isn’t much like “love” at all. It looks and feels a lot like friendship. But if you listen close and pay attention, you see the signs of it all around them. The product of their love for each other is evident in the support systems that they engage and uphold so diligently. </p>

			<p>They love this community, Mills 50, and that shows in their support for it. They are unbelievably talented and creative people, who clearly have so much to offer the world as a whole, but hone their strengths into elevating the culture and identity of their neighborhood and city. That takes a lot of love. Their efforts certainly reflect well upon them, likely to allow them passage into the next rung of their undoubtedly bright futures. But not for a moment is any of their output so selfish. </p>

			<p>No, they well represent the city, and they actively seek to better it through art, music, and community events. Where they see the opportunity to push their city or neighborhood forward, they take it, and people will be there behind them, watching, encouraging, inspired. I can say that I am.</p>

			<p>This kind of love transcends the efforts of good work and great intentions. Arkie and Winter love each other in a way so beautiful and complex, that as much as I’ll try to express it, I probably won’t get it right. It is as quaint as it is strong. The two of them provide foundation for one another and have learned to build themselves through the push for one another. </p>

			<p>It’s clear as day in spending time with them. Winter still gets excited to watch Arkie play a show. Despite putting together the set pieces and ornaments that fill the scene around him and knowing every note and line from hearing hours of his practicing. Even still, when the lights drop and he knocks his drumstick to the electric pad, Winter stands there, engulfed and enamored, his biggest fan.</p>

			<p>By the same hand, Arkie makes mention to his collaborations with Winter often, inspired and honored to have her as a partner. His appreciation for her art is pure — not without honesty, but mesmerized by the beauty of her craft. The love they share is electric. It isn’t gross and sexualized, it’s the love that is made to last, compounding with every passing moment, cemented by it’s own existence.</p>

			<p>So by the end of this episode, I won’t have said it, but the strength of love emanating from Arkie and Winter should be clear. And if it’s not, I’ll have failed you, because it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve had the honor to muse.</p>
