			<h2>Improvising</h2>
			<h3>By Andrew Nater</h3>

				<p>
					It's curious how hard we fight for the things we love. What we believe in. The things that feel good. They're all worth the good fight, the dedication, the hard work. All that. It's something I've come to be acquainted with in producing this show.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Not only through my own struggles — believe me, the mishaps are bountiful — but also in seeing Jimmy's passion. It shines through every note he breathes. You feel it in his presence. He loves it, it moves him forward. There’s a hint of it that we all can catch in spending time with him, it’s inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					We got the chance to capture that. Although it wasn't <em>exactly</em> the way I'd planned it, it still felt right. In the beginning of any project, there will always be mistakes. For the first episode, it changed the course of the entire project — a simple lack of audio.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, everything was perfect. The location was good, the conversation was great, and the footage caught it all. What we lacked was adequate recording equipment, the key to keeping that conversation on record. Poised with a situation where we had no dialogue audio, we had to pivot. I narrated, and it was done — the show had a new direction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surprisingly, it worked.
				</p>
				<p>
					Had we forced it and canceled our first day of filming over a pretty massive oversight, Unfold would be a very different project. This episode wouldn’t be quite the same, and while there’s no way to say if that’s for better or worse, I’m still glad. I think it was bit like a Phoenix — one (idea) died, and through it’s ashes, another was born.
				</p>
				<p>
					We weren't bound by a location, linear storytelling, or following the details of a conversation. We found freedom and serendipity through miscalculation. The footage came to express the essence of the project. It was, to my surprise, all that I had envisioned. Everything came together perfectly, imperfectly.
				</p>
				<p>
					This episode is about passion. It's about dedication and hard work. As serious as all that comes off, it's the ability to "just go with it" and "let it happen" that lights the path to greatness. As with most things, balance is all you need. Sometimes keeping a tight grip on everything, planning down to the seconds, and forcing it isn't enough — it's often too much. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope what people get out of this episode is that you have to sweat a bit. You have to put your neck out there and risk it if you want to do something worthwhile. Jimmy does it for his music. We do it for Unfold. Artists and creators risk it because it means something and it feels good. For everyone watching, I hope you feel that. I want it to fill you up and inspire something great.
				</p>
				<p>
					So get out there. Create. Unfold.
				</p>
				<p>
					I honestly believe what we've created is nothing short of impressive. Something different, but something worth while. I really hope that anyone who watches enjoys it as much as I do. I owe many thanks to everyone who helped to make this happen — you know who you are.
