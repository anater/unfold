			<h2>Deceptively Delightful</h2>
			<h3>By Andrew Nater</h3>

			<p>I like to think of myself as open minded. I’m often surprised by how much that is and isn’t true. Spending time with anyone tends to be a catalyst for this thinking, but spending time with Zack made me realize how closed minded I can be. I don’t really like tattoos. They aren’t for me. Still, I worked past the blaring sound of needles to take it all in and earn a deeper understanding of them. They can be beautiful, important even. For the most part, they mean something. In this world, we get to choose our marks and bare them for life — a uniquely daring bout of intimacy. Taken from that view, who could hate them that much?</p>

			<p>I found that I actually don’t. I’m scared of them. I don’t necessarily want one, but now I approach them with less distaste and far more appreciation. Whatever your opinion of them may be, please understand that — as with most things — there is certainly more than meets the eye. Transformers… yes, I know, but my point stands.</p>

			<p>This episode embodies the theme of Unfold quite well. Maybe its Zack, maybe its what we talked about, or how the story came together. I really don’t know, but I’m glad about it.</p>

			<p>My goal with Unfold was to tell the stories that nobody else bothered to, because it might have been too ambitious or, maybe, too boring. These are stories about people you will literally see every day, walking by you in your hometown, the people who look at you funny because they know you aren’t from there. Those people have so many fantastic stories and personalities that deserve attention. My favorites, however, are the ones you least expect. Stories from people like Zack.</p>

			<p>He looks intimidating and he’s one of the warmest people in the world. The guy is seriously a teddy bear. He’s also passionate, incredibly and exuberantly passionate. It’s perfect. There’s nothing quite like capturing passion. Particularly over food. It’s all around the table. There are shots of Zack, Katie, and me melting over bites of food. To be fair, it’s Cask & Larder, and if that doesn’t happen, something is horribly wrong.</p>

			<p>Zack loves to cook, he sidelines his income with beautiful tattoo work, and he has a taste for great drinks and music. We explored some of the finer things Orlando has to offer — delectable southern food, craft popsicles, and mixed drinks. A day in the city with Zack will quickly remind you why Orlando is a place worth spending time in. I find that the best way to be in Orlando is with someone who can show you their favorite spots. Orlando love might be tricky to come by, but it’s infectious. You’ll be enchanted by a good time with a seasoned Orlandoan.</p>

			<p>I think things came together better than expected. I keep going into these things with an idea, and find that it won’t go that way — a valuable life lesson. This time, however, I let myself succumb to the ambiguity. I looked over the footage we had, taped together with my memories of profound conversation, and I honed in. It wasn’t all tattoo talk, it wasn’t about influence and inspiration, it wasn’t even entirely about where we were. It was about food and humanity and experience. This episode is about embracing the moment. Life goes too fast, in too many directions, to anticipate what it could be. Nobody can be certain of anything. In fact, if I’m certain of anything, it’s that I don’t really know anything. And, slowly, I’m becoming okay with that.</p>
